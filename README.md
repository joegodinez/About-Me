## Hi there!

![A picture of me!](me.jpg)

I'm Joseph Godinez, but you can call me Joe. You've found the part of my Github page where you can learn a bit more about me and what I have done since I started my undergraduate career. 

If you're looking for:
- A quick, one-page resume -> [quick_resume.pdf](quick_resume.pdf)
- A longer, more detailed resume -> [long_resume.pdf](long_resume.pdf)
